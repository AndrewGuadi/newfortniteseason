        <h3 class="fs-3">Metallica (Fortnite Festival)</h3>
        <p class="fs-4">According to a leaked Fortnite roadmap for 2024, Metallica is slated to headline the Fortnite Festival during Season 3. This means the iconic band will take center stage in the game, and their music will likely feature prominently.

        <h3 class="fs-3">Pirates of the Caribbean</h3>
        <p class="fs-4">Another exciting collaboration on the horizon is with Pirates of the Caribbean. Leaked information suggests that this collaboration could arrive in July during Season 3. Notably, it might extend beyond the typical Battle Royale mode, potentially introducing a “Pirate Adventure” map for Fortnite Rocket Racing. If it follows the trend set by previous crossovers (like Star Wars), we can expect more than just skins and emotes.</p>

        <p class="fs-4">The Dragon Ball franchise has been collaborating with Epic Games for a while now. Recent leaks hint at the arrival of Trunks as a playable character in Fortnite. While specific dates are still unknown, this insider information has been accurate in the past. Get ready for some high-flying action from the Dragon Ball universe.</p>
