        <h3 class="fs-3">Vehicle Attachments</h3>
        <p class="fs-4">Leaks suggest that vehicle attachments will be introduced in Season 3. These attachments could drastically change gameplay by allowing players to modify their vehicles. While weapon modifications were already introduced at the start of Chapter 5, vehicles did not receive such special upgrades until now. With these attachments, players might be able to enhance their vehicles in unique ways, such as adding mounted guns or other features.</p>

        <h3 class="fs-3">Mobility Items</h3>
        <p class="fs-4">Epic Games has teased the return of some classic mobility items for Season 3. These include:</p>
        <ul class="fs-4 text-start">
          <li><strong>Impulse Grenade:</strong> Known for its ability to provide extra air time and annoy opponents, the Impulse Grenade could make a comeback.</li>
          <li><strong>Crash Pad:</strong> A versatile item that can deflect rockets, grenades, and even be thrown while in freefall, saving players from fall damage.</li>
          <li><strong>Bounder:</strong> Although less commonly used, the Bounder provides unique mobility options and could also return.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="fs-4">Having these mobility items available is crucial for navigating the large Fortnite map efficiently, especially in a post-apocalyptic setting like the one hinted at in Season 3.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="vehicle-item mb-4">
        <h3 class="fs-3">Apocalyptic Theme</h3>
        <p class="fs-4">Rumors and speculation suggest that Season 3 will feature an apocalyptic theme. Voice lines from The Oracle, a character in the current season, hint at impending doom, black skies, and choking dust. There may be a war brewing between Greek gods and those who oppose them, adding to the apocalyptic vibe.</p>
